# Save2Switch
_A program that just copies you save files from PC to your Switch, and vice versa._

## What it does/not?
All it does is connect to your switch, that should be hosting a FTP server, and copies a save from your pc to a JKSV foulder.

For now i'm not messing with decoding saves, maybe later I'll put more options to specific games that require more trouble to copy your saves.

## How it does it?
### Main Window
When you open the app for the first time this it what you'll see:

| White Theme | Dark Theme|
|-------------|-----------|

### Adding a save
To add a game you just click the "+" icon and it will ask some info about the app, like:
- The name of the game
- The path to the PC save
- The name of the game in JKSV
- Your switch IP
- And optionally the path to an icon for the preview image.
* _OBS: you can edit this info later_

Then it will display your games like this:

| White Theme| Dark Theme |
|------------|-------------|

Then you can just click in "switch" or "pc" to copy your files from one system to another !
